Steps to setup virtual environment :
1. Through command prompt of the project directory type in "pipenv shell"
2. Install the django package using "pip install django"
3. Install psycopg2 package using "pip install psycopg2"

running the code :
1. Create the migartion files through "python manage.py makemigrations"
2. Migrate the code using "python manage.py migrate"

If had more time :
1. Probably would have tried to learn the framework first and then build the service
2. would have used user authentication service to store user info 
3. HTML file templates could have been simplifed a bit
